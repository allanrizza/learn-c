# learn-c

This repository is dedicated to my progress in mastering the C programming language, using "https://www.learn-c.org" as a base. Here, I store my code as I learn syntax, data structures, low-level programming, and procedural programming. Feel free to explore my work and follow along as I advance my skills in this powerful language.
